Project: LARL III Scripts extra paging list

Purpose: This script was created because the III automation system does not
keep track of customers requests very well.  The request system and paging
system has many holes for requests to slip into and get lost, and there are
design choices and UI choices that were made that seem to guarantee that
a certain percentage of requests will never get filled in a timely manner
without staff intervention.  The amount of staff time to handle these tasks
became too much, so these scripts were created to automate the task.

How does it work:  One expect script automates the process of running a create
list to gather all the available items that have bib level holds.  It exports
the data in CSV format, and ftp's the file from the III server, saving it
locally.

A second perl script processes the data, replicating the priority paging setup,
creates a paging list for each branch, and emails the list to each location.

Notes:
  - This system does not have the same limitations of paging that the III
 system has.  If there are multiple holds and multiple availible items, they
 will all get paged at once.  This solves the book club problem.
