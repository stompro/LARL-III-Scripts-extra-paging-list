Why was this list sent?</b>&nbsp; These bibs have holds that were placed
more than 7 days ago.&nbsp; Normally most holds are filled within the first
7 days they are placed when there are available items.&nbsp; If a hold isn't
filled in that time and there are available items it usually means it
was missed for one of these reasons.<br>

<ol>
  <li>The hold moved off of the paging list before staff ran the paging
list.&nbsp; Bibs that are on the paging list more than 72 hours from when
they are placed, will move off the paging list and on to the next
location.&nbsp; If there is no next location the holds just fall of the
list.&nbsp; This is most likely to happen to holds placed on weekends on
items at location that are closed on Mondays or Tuesday.</li>
  <li>Staff placed a hold for a customer when there was a locally
available copy.&nbsp; The system does not page in this situation because the
item can just be pulled off the shelf at that point.</li>
  <li>The hold had a NNB(Not Needed Before) date set, which means it is
paged right when the hold was placed, but cannot be filled until after
that date.</li>
  <li>The hold was frozen, and just recently unfrozen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The item wasn't pulled from the shelf when it was paged, and it
wasn't marked Damaged,Tracking Down, or Missing.</li>
  <li>Staff didn't click the "Page for Title" button when placing the
hold, so the item was never on the paging list.</li>
  <li>Some system error or code inconsistency caused the page to never
be generated.</li>

</ol>
<b>Book Clubs:</b> One other situation is when multiple holds are
placed on multiple available items at the same time, such as when a
book club wants to request copies for all of its members.&nbsp; The normal
paging system can only page one item at a time, so it would take 72
hours * number of items for them all to be filled.&nbsp; They will show up
on these list after 7 days, letting every location that has one of the
items know at once.<br>
<br>
<b>What should I do if I cannot find the item?<br>
</b>
<ul>
  <li>If you want more time to look for the item, change its status to
"Tracking Down".</li>
  <li>If the item is missing, change its status to "MISSING".</li>
  <li>If the item is damaged, change its status to "DAMAGED".</li>

</ul>
When you change the status of the item, please also look to see if
there is any other possibility of the hold being filled, remembering
that LINK Sites, and Express items won't fill holds.&nbsp; If there are
other items that were recently checked out(less than a month ago),
chances are this hold will eventually be filled.&nbsp; If all the other
items are long overdue, missing, or damaged, then chances are the hold
will never be filled.&nbsp; If it looks like the hold will never be filled,
please send an email to the customers home library so they can
reevaluate the hold and see about requesting it some other way.<br>
